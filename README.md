**E-Commerce Website (MERN Stack)**

This is a basic E-commerce web application built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The platform allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products, manage user authentication, and view product details. Users can browse product listings, search for specific items, and view product details with images and descriptions. Admins have the ability to manage products and orders through a dedicated dashboard. The backend is powered by Express.js and MongoDB, ensuring a smooth data management process, while the frontend is developed using React.js with Redux for state management. Authentication is implemented with JWT for secure access. The application is responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices. This project serves as a foundational E-commerce platform with essential features for product management and user authentication.
